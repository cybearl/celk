/**
 * The `BinarySearch` class provides a way to search for a value in a sorted array.
 * The search is performed by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
 * If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval,
 * the search continues in the lower half of the interval. If the value of the search key is greater
 * than the item in the middle, the search continues in the upper half of the interval.
 * This process continues until the value is found or the interval is empty.
