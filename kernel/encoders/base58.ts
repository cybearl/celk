/**
 * The `Base58Encoder` class is used to encode data coming from a
 * `Cache` instance to a Base58 string based on the current encoding.
 *
 * It also provides methods to decode Base58 strings back to
 * their bytecode and write them directly in a `Cache` instance
 * at a certain position given by a `MemorySlot` object.
 *
 * More info about the Base58 encoding can be found at:
